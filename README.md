[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nano-io/nano-time.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nano-io/nano-time) &nbsp; [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/nano-io/release/nano-time/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/nano-io/release/nano-time/_latestVersion)

### Overview
Native JNI support for wall clock times in microsecond and nanosecond precision.
This precision comes at the expense of an extra 5ns invocation cost over the regular method `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

### Building the Project
Run the following command to build the project:

```
mvn clean install
```

The build process will generate the following file:

> target/nano-time-<version>.jar

### Using the Code

Once built, you will need to add the maven dependency to your project.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.nano</groupId>
    <artifactId>nano-time</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

In your java code it is a simple matter of calling the static method.

```
long micros = NanoTime.currentTimeMicros();
long nanos = NanoTime.currentTimeNanos()
```
The native library is loaded automatically from the jar.

### Benchmarks

Since this is a very small project, it would be overkill to split the banchmarks out into a separate project.
Due to this, benchmarks.jar is not created.

You can run the benchmarks using the exec plugin:

```
mvn exec:exec
```
These results were run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Intel Core i7-8550 @ 1.80GHz.

```
Benchmark                                Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units
NanoTimeBench.currentTimeMillis        avgt   25  20.396 ± 0.054  ns/op
NanoTimeBench.nanoTime                 avgt   25  20.813 ± 0.935  ns/op
NanoTimeBench.currentTimeMicros        avgt   25  25.900 ± 1.246  ns/op
NanoTimeBench.currentTimeNanos         avgt   25  25.117 ± 1.479  ns/op
```

### Supported Architectures
The downloadable binaries currently only build on *Ubuntu* but there should be no reason not to build locally as long as gcc is installed.

#### TODO
 - The native calls do not appear to benefit from JavaCritical optimizations, and in fact appeared to be ever so slightly slower, so have been removed.
